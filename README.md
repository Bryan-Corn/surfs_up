# Surfs Up!

## Overview:

Weather data from 8/24/2016 to 8/23/2017 was collected from each station in Hawaii, narrowed down to Oahu, and then analyzed to determine the viability and best location of a Surf and Icecream shop. Statistical data for temperature measurements for June and December are as follows:

## Results:
```
• The mean temperature is slightly higher in June than in December.
• The temperature varies more in December with a ~ 8 degree lower minimum than in June.
• The high temps for both months are similar, with June having a high of only 2 degrees higher than December.

```


## Summary:

The Surf and Ice-cream shop seems viable year-round. While things may slow down a bit in the winter, there should be plenty of warm and dry days to make it worthwhile to remain open. Further analysis on rainfall data, shown below, indicates the same trends with temperature. December has slightly more rainfall but both months are pretty similar in variance and max rainfall amounts:

Further research could include wind data and ocean temperatures to make sure the days are pleasant for ice-cream eating and surfing.
